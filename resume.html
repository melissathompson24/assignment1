                <h2>A Brief Summary</h2>

                <p>With over 11 years of successful experience in managing teams to coordinate technology management, web development, training logistics, office operations, and marketing and branding, I am guided by an intrinsic drive to constantly learn and challenge myself.</p>

                <p>These various roles have given me hands-on experience in planning, designing, implementing, and managing a wide variety of areas and projects. I have focused on deadline-driven performance and execution, while building, fostering, and maintaining successful relationships with teams, partners, and clients alike.</p>

                <p>I have found the key to my success is my ability to see and analyze the larger picture, as well as drilling down to the required details in order to plan, implement,and deliver each initiative as needed.</p> 

                <p>I am "designer" by nature, and embrace new challenges that allow me the opportunity to design an initiative from inception to implementation.</p>
