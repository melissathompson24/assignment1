                    <h1>About Section 508 Standards, Universal Design, and Accessibility Approaches</h1>

                    <p>Published on <time datetime="2014-01-15" pubdate>January 15, 2014</time>.</p>

                    <p>Over the past few months at work I have been asked about Section 508 and what it really means within the context of the work we do. I currently work for a non-profit, human-services institute, housed within a university. We are 99% grant-funded, and many of our projects are federally funded. This is why Section 508 has started creeping into our conversations.</p>

                    <p>At first, I was just as unclear about what this deceptively innocuously sounding law means and its implications to us. But since I figured that in the case of federal government dollars, ignorance is not bliss, I had better begin studying-up on this dense law and its implications to us.</p>

                    <p>Although my exploration into this law is only at the beginning, here are my findings so far…</p>

                    <p>At the heart of Section 508 is the expectation that any electronic and information technology that is developed using federal dollars or for federal use is also developed in a way that makes it accessible to those with disabilities. You can read the official definition on <a href="http://www.section508.gov/summary-section508-standards">Section 508 website</a>, but be warned—as expected on a federal site, it is long and convoluted.</p>

                    <p>As the <a href="http://www.section508.gov/summary-section508-standards">Section 508 website</a> goes on to explain, this law covers the following systems developed under, for, or when used by, the federal government:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>software applications and operating systems</li>
                        <li>web-based information or applications</li>
                        <li>telecommunication products</li>
                        <li>video and multimedia products</li>
                        <li>self-contained, closed products (e.g., information kiosks, calculators, and fax machines)</li>
                        <li>desktop and portable computers</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>As I became more familiar with this law, I also became aware of the complementary Universal Design movement that is become more widespread in the field of instructional design. Basically Universal Design centers around the idea to “<a href="http://www.universaldesign.com/universal-design.html">[make] things safer, easier and more convenient for everyone.</a>” </p>

                    <p>Applying Universal Design principles to designing systems and products would mean that they would be designed to allow anyone to access the information in a variety of ways. The development of a video can be used as an example of this principle: Not only would the video be developed to be watched, but captioning would also be included as an option, and possibly a script made available as well. This would allow a person to access the video in the way that make it easiest for that person to process the information, whether it be through watching, listening, or reading the information.</p>

                    <p>Of course there are many other considerations when designing accessible systems and products. The <a href="http://ncdae.org/resources/factsheets/principles.php">National Center on Disability and Access to Education</a> summarizes some general global principles nicely on their website. They <a href="http://ncdae.org/resources/factsheets/principles.php">list</a> the following practices:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>the use of alt text for any graphics</li>
                        <li>content that is clearly-written and structured-well</li>
                        <li>use of headers in data tables</li>
                        <li>ensuring links make sense out of context </li>
                        <li>caption and provide transcripts for media</li>
                        <li>ensure users can complete and submit all forms</li>
                        <li>don’t rely on color to convey meaning</li>
                        <li>design to standards</li>
                        <li>ensure accessibility on non-HTML content</li>
                    </ul>

                     <p>I realize this is truly a shallow-dive into the world of <a href="http://www.section508.gov/summary-section508-standards">Section 508</a>, <a href="http://www.universaldesign.com/universal-design.html">Universal Design</a>, and accessibility, but as I progress on my understanding of this world and its practices, tools, and resources, I am finding that this theme is becoming more widespread across industries, whether it’s government contracting and funding, instructional design and education, or <a href="http://www.remodeling.hw.net/how-to/use-this-quick-primer-to-incorporate-universal-design-into-your-work_o">home design</a>. The ubiquitous expectation and application of accessibility has made this approach to design in all of our work, no matter the audience or funder, a common practice that cannot be ignored.</p>
